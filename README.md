# Data-Driven Integrated Solvent and Process Design

This repository contains the data and scripts involved in the manuscript:

**Data-Driven Integrated Design of Solvents and Extractive Distillation Processes**

## Requirements 
### Library (Python 3.6)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): data-driven modeling
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): data processing
* [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/): multi-objective optimization 
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): visualization

### Software
* Aspen Plus: chemical process simulation

## Note
The process simulation involved in this work is largely supported by our automatic simulation tool, which can be found in "[**Automatic Process Simulation in Aspen Plus**](https://github.com/zwang1995/Aspen-Plus-Automation)".
